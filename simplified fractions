Given an integer n, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) 
such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to n. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: ["1/2"]
Explanation: "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.


class Solution:
    def simplifiedFractions(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        out = {}
        ans = []
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(i+1,n+1):
                if i/j not in out:
                    out[i/j]=1
                    ans.append(str(i)+"/"+str(j))
        return ans
