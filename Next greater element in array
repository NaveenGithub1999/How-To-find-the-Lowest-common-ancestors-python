The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.        
        
        
        
        
        ans_arr=[]
        #loop through nums1
        for i in nums1:
            #default value for answer (if no greater val found)
            ans = -1
            #find the index of that number within nums2
            index_two = nums2.index(i)
            #temp array: slice off the rest of the array after the index
            temp = nums2[index_two+1:]
            #loop through temp array
            for j in temp:
                #if item in temp is greater than i
                if j > i:
                    #make that the answer
                    ans = j
                    #break the loop (we only need to find the first greater value)
                    break
            #add ans to the answer array - if we havent found a greater val it'll still be -1
            ans_arr.append(ans)
        #bring it home
        return ans_arr
